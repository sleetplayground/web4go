          <p>
            If you know the NEAR account, you can just type it in to a browser and add .page to the end.
            However, this only works for master accounts. This tool enables browsing content on Web4 from subaccounts.

          <h3>What is Web4?</h3>
          <p>
            Web4 is the future of the web using IPFS and NEAR. Learn more at
            <a href="https://web4.near.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> web4.near.page</a>,
            you can submit apps at
            <a href="https://awesomeweb4.near.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> awesomeweb4.near.page</a>

        <div className="details-card">
          <h3>Will this tool become obsolete?</h3>
          <p>
            Our current main goal is to allow users to access Web4 sites that are deployed to subaccounts.
            While there may be an easier solution in the future, we also want this to be a platform for
            discovering apps and people on Web4.
