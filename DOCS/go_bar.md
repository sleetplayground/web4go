# The GO bar

The link hub search bar text input box will be
so powerful that I decided to give it a name


dynamic routing /randomnearaccount.near wil bring up a users linkhub profile and a /command after will redirect them to one of the links

---


### / slash commands

randomnearaccount.near/command

/ slash commands that should work for any near account
- /block - https://nearblocks.io/address/ - https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/
- /pikespeak - https://pikespeak.ai/wallet-explorer/
- /social - https://near.social/ - (for this the sample url for user example nonresistant.near is nonresistant.near.social, only works for accounts that are not subaccounts) prbably the easiest way to do this is use this url: https://near.social/mob.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=
- /page - https://near.page/ - https://testnet.page/ - (example for nonresistant.near nonresistant.near.page) - only works for accounts that are not subaccounts, and not every near acount may have a web4 page set up
- /on - https://onsocial.id/onsocial.near/widget/ProfilePage?accountId=

comands that will only work if they have a linkhub profile setup
- /hub - the defalt command so they don't need to enter the slash, will bring to their linkhub profile
- /github
- /x
- /medium
- /telegram
- /discord
- /facebook


each of these slash commands will have their own pages? maybe not sure what is necesary
but i want to have dynamic routing so that if i have my app depoyed to linkhub.near.page/
they can type theeir near account and slash command in the adressbar (linkhub.near.page/nonresistant/github) to be redirected to link.
I was thinking a page on my app that kind of has a nice screen brefore rediecting them
